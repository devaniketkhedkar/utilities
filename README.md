# create all days folders and text files of month at once
Small Daily Use Utilities 
1. Create Daywise folders and Daywise File in it.

We Work Everyday in Office, while working in office I have developed a habit of noting down the things I have to do today.
With this I save important notes of Special thing done in that day, a screenshot of an issue I am working on.
So, I keep them in folder of that day and a text file of that day. 

It helps me to find out what I did on a particular day while I was working. This resulted in proper Journaling on my everyday work. 
Even while leaving office I create a folder and a text file for next day mentioning what I have to do tomorrow.
